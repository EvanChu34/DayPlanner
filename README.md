# DayPlanner

The Day planner program is meant to help keep track of the schedule the user puts in. This application was used with Luxon.js to produce the time elements.  It has preset work hours, Starting at 9 am EST, and ending at 5pm EST. The current date will appear under the top header. As time goes on, the current hour will be highlighted red, indicating the present. All past events will be highlighted in grey. The future events will be highlighted in neon green. The user type events they have planned during the day. Once the user presses the save button, the typed event will stay in the event box. The save button is currently having issues with local storage. I will be working on this in the near future.
